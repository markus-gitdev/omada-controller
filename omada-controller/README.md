# Omada Controller from TP-Link for Home Assistant
This add-on brings the Omada Controller from TP-Link directly into Home Assistant.

The Add-On uses Matt Bentleys [docker-omada-cotroller](https://github.com/mbentley/docker-omada-controller) as a base and was changed to work with Home Assistant.
The used version is represented in the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md).
